# Decision Tree Regression: Salary Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use **Decision Tree Regression** to predict salaries based on job position levels. It is a classic example of applying regression techniques to non-linear data.

## Project Structure
- `decision_tree_regression.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the regression model, training, predictions, and visualizations.
- `Position_Salaries.csv`  
  Dataset with job positions, their levels, and corresponding salaries.

## Features
- Loads and explores the salary dataset.
- Fits a Decision Tree Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Makes predictions for specific levels.
- Visualizes how the decision tree captures non-linear relationships.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-regression-salary-prediction.git
cd decision-tree-regression-salary-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
